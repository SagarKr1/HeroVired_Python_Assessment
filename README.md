#            Plan and Strategy Discussion
#      ===========================================
#  Step 1 : Dividing the modules into two parts: the first part is 'User,' and the second part is 'Admin'.

#  Step 2 : Adding modules to the 'User' section: Ticket Booking, Financial Transactions, and Student Discounts.

#  Step 3 : Adding modules to the 'Admin' section: Employee Salary Management and Business Sales Analytics.

#               Implementation of the plan we discussed. 
#       ========================================================
#   Step 1 : The user has three options to select: 1. User, 2. Admin, 9. Exit.

#   Step 2 : 1. User (User Section Implementation)
#          ----> In the User Section, there are two subsections: Ticket and Wallet/Balance.
#          ----> In the Wallet Section, the user can deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.

#          ----> In the Ticket Section, there are two sub-sections: Book Ticket, View Ticket and Search Ticket by ID (Student ID or Ticket ID).
#          ----> In the Book Ticket section, the user can add multiple tickets and also check whether they are a student or not.
#          ----> In the View Ticket section, the user can see booked tickets. 
#          ----> In the Search Section, the user can search for data using the student ID and ticket ID.

#    Step 3 : 2. Admin (Admin Section Implementation) 
#           ----> In the Admin section, there are two subsections: Employee and Sales.

#           ----> In the Employee section, the user can add an employee, view employee data, sort employee data, and update salaries.

#           ----> In the Sales section, the user can add sales data, view sales data, and analyze sales data.
